# TODO: This needs to do the following:
# - Notice when mid-disk blocks cannot be moved, and attempt to avoid letting them split a file into pieces
# - Try to move blocks so that they're near to the center of the disk, rather than right at the beginning
# - Move inode table entries as well (though, this first needs to be implemented in pyext2)
